## Current
I am a junior working on my BS in Computer Science at Northwest Missouri State University. I currently do not have a minor, but I'm interested in pursing a minor in chemistry or interactive digital media. I have plans to stay in the KC area after my graduation in Spring 2023.
## Background
I'm from Paola, KS and I had no prior experience with computer science until I became a student at Northwest. In my free time, I enjoy vinyl collecting, coffee, and reading.
## Career Plans
In regard to my career plans, I was an IT intern at H&R Block during Summer 2021 and primarily worked on AI development with Azure and VSCode. As part of my internship, I developed a chat bot that was in charge of the companies' software releases. In the future, I hope to work in a creative field while using my degree. I would love to learn more about website design and digital media.
